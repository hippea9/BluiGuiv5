# BluiGuiv5
The 5th iteration of my Blue GUI Project. 

Before I get into the nitty-gritty of it, I'd like to warn you in advance, this program will write it's own folder inside your appdata folder for it to work, so if that isn't something you're okay with, I understand; though the alternative is to use a flash drive. 
If you are comfortable with that, then I'd like you to know how the program works. 
When you first open it, it's going to ask whether or not you're going to use it on a flash drive. 
You can use it in conjunction with a flash drive flawlessly (as far as I know). 
The only difference will be that the folders and text files will be put onto the flash drive instead of your hard drive's appdata folder. 
From there you'll be put into the menu. 
Now, the program is essentially a quicker way to access a directory, file, or program, or a combination of those, all with a phrase. 
You'll want set a bind in the binds submenu, and by 'a bind' I mean a sequence of letters, numbers, symbols, punctuation, or a mixture of them all, which when when used in the quicky submenu (and activated with your submit key, which you can check in the options submenu (the default is 'q')) will execute and open a directory/program/file that you set.
Though when inputing your desired command, in the case that you somehow don't know the full directory path, you can input 'n', and a open file dialoge explorer will open, allowing you to select your file/program/whatever (but not a folder, for that you'll have to paste in the path).
After you put in one command, you'll be prompted on whether or not you want to add others.
When you've added the commands you'd like, just click cancel.
You'll be asked to write a description, but it's an optional part of the process.
I touched on it a bit, but to execute your command, you'll first want to navigate to the quicky submenu.
When in the submenu, just type out your corresponding bind to the command you want to execute and hit your submit key (the default is 'q', but it can be changed in the options submenu).
If you forget your bind, do not fear, hold down the control key, and your bind list and their corresponding commands will be shown.
That's all there is to it. 
The only thing that doesn't completely work at the moment is the help button in the options submenu, other than that, everything should work as explained.
If you find any bugs or problems, let me know.
